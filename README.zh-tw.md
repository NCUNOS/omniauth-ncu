此為社群版本之可用於[中央大學](http://www.ncu.edu.tw)認證之 OmniAuth strategy。 使用前你可能需要先前往[中央大學 OAuth 應用服務管理](https://api.cc.ncu.edu.tw/manage/developer/client/list)申請 Client ID 以及 Client Secret。

## 基礎用法

```
use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :ncu, ENV['NCU_CLIENT_ID'], ENV['NCU_CLIENT_SECRET']
end
```

## Scope

NCU OAuth API 提供你設定 scopes 來取得不同資料的存取權限：

```
use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :ncu, ENV['NCU_CLIENT_ID'], ENV['NCU_CLIENT_SECRET'], scope: "user.info.basic.read,course.schedule.read"
end
```
